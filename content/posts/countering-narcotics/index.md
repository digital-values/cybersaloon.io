During my tenure conducting counter-narcotics operations, I was heavily vested in any criminal activity related to China. Having read and understood their 50-year plan for world dominance, I felt that I could make a difference at the tactical level that would, at the very least, have an impact on the surrounding neighborhoods within my area of responsibility.

Well, I bit off way more than I could chew... My immediate supervisor tailored this strategic interest of mine for other projects surrounding drug kingpins influencing major drug trafficking operations. Like a good soldier, I didn't deviate from that path. As a matter of fact, these strategic projects laid the groundwork, enabling me to understand the connection between China and Mexico. I thoroughly enjoyed working strategic projects from time to time, especially being that I was operating at the tactical level, that work really tied everything in.

Summer time in San Diego, the air was warm and the wind was crisp, I had been working an investigation into a Sinaloa linked-Tijuana based drug trafficking cell. We received a tip from our source that a truck load of drugs would be attempting to enter the United States in a few hours. There was no time to waste. I worked up the information received by the source and began searching for faces to this anticipated load - this preliminary research would increase officer safety and decrease the time it takes to break down a subject during post-arrest. My disappointment came early. The information we received was properly deconflicted through our local fusion center but our federal partner agency decided to swing their ego and overtake their
