This was an interesting journey. I first got the idea to introduce some of my personal work from a good friend and colleague of mine who specializes in malware. Being employed in the cloak and dagger division has eliminated my desire to share, be open, and display any resemblance of myself - especially my work, to the public. 

However, I created this website to ease myself into the public's eye, create a center of gravity for other professionals to be inspired, and continue to challenge myself with new projects. Feel free to send me an email with your thoughts. Thank you for stopping by.
