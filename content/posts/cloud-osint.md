Cloud Open Source Intelligence

I was recently offered the opportunity to teach a class on Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) and was alloted 70 minutes for a presentation. After submitting a concept of my 70-minute class to the administration, I began to triple-check the content of my class and if I was approaching the need of my audience correctly. Part of following that rabbit hole led me to research the available open source tools and projects. 

A few days ago one of my colleagues asked for any resources I had for pentesting cloud environments, I guess I was considered a subject matter expert since I just got funding for the SEC588 SANS course (Cloud Penetration Testing)
