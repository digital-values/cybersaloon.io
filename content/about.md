After several life endeavors, I wound up joining the military and gaining a foothold in what I was interested in... national security. During this period of time I was appalled at the curriculum in my chosen field. Our military instructors were still teaching conventional warfare and preparing future soldiers to assist decision makers by providing most likely & most dangerous courses of action for tank-on-tank battles. My young brain was amazed that these soviet-era tactics were still being taught in a modern world.

But then on February 2022, Ukraine was invaded by Russia. My instructors would probably travel a long way to make me perform push-ups until I could hear the artillery shells in the Ukrainian sky myself. Jokes aside, tank on tank warfare was on, but the real difference in this war is how the world is digesting a new approach to Multi-Domain Operations. We are currently witnessing the role of cyber warfare in a real conventional war. This is truly the dawn of a new era.

Observing The Ukraine War and European events enabled me to understand the cyber kill-chain in action. Aside from the experience I have gained as a service member, I have also done stints in counter-narcotics, defense civil service operations, stability operations, anti-human trafficking, counter-intelligence, and offensive cyber operations initiatives. All views expressed are solely my own and independent of any federal, state, local government entity as well as private and commercial entities I may be employed or contracted by. Thank you for reading about me.
